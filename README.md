# About
Send NASANEWS to 32458 to get the latest breaking news from the official NASA
RSS feed at: [https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/breaking_news.rss](https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/breaking_news.rss).

Terms and Conditions available at: [https://www.portatext.com/terms-and-conditions/nasa-news.html](https://www.portatext.com/terms-and-conditions/nasa-news.html).

This is a completely serverless demonstration of how to combine the [PortaText](https://www.portatext.com/)
service and API with [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to create an SMS service in a short code.

This service will send you at most 1 message per day with a breaking news from
NASA (and another one extra as soon as you opt-in to the service.).

For more information read the blog post [NASANEWS: Serverless SMS Service with a Short Code in the cloud](https://blog.portatext.com/2016/11/19/nasanews-serverless-sms-service-short-code-cloud/).
